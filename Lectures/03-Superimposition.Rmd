# What is Shape?

- **Morphometrics**: variation in shape and its covariation with other variables

- What is shape?
    - The 'form' of an object
    - Subtractive definition: whatever is NOT size
    - In GM: the geometric properties of an object that are invariant to effects of location, scale and orientation

    - The 'form' of an object
    - Subtractive definition: whatever is NOT size
    - In GM: the geometric properties of an object that are invariant to effects of location, scale and orientation

include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/SuperIdea.png")  
```

# Scale and Size

- Position and orientation are due to digitizing procedures, and are not biologically relevant for most applications

- **Scale** includes the combined effects of focal distance during digitizing and “real” size variation

- Digitizing scale is calibrated during data acquisition

- **Size** is of biological interest. So, we standardize for it to obtain shape variables, but record it for subsequent analyses

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/scale.png")  
```


###### Note: one can perform GM analyses without recording digitizing 'scale', but in this case one has no inherent size estimate, and no notion of its effect on shape

# Size in GM Studies

- Small objects: landmarks are closer together

- Large objects: landmarks are further apart

- So, in GM, size is associated to the dispersion of landmark coordinates

# Size in GM Studies

- Small objects: landmarks are closer together

- Large objects: landmarks are further apart

- So, in GM, size is associated to the dispersion of landmark coordinates

- **Centroid size**: the square root of the sum of the squared distances between each landmark and the centroid (center of mass of the object) of the landmark configuration:

$$\small{CS}=\sqrt{\sum_{i,j}^{k,p}\left(\mathbf{Y}_{ij}-\mathbf{Y}_{ic}\right)^2}$$

where $\small{p}$ is the number of landmarks and $\small{k}$ is the number of coordinate dimensions

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/CSize.png")  
```

# Centroid Size (CS): Properties

- One could use other size measures (a baseline, area, perimeter, …)
- BUT, centroid size has some useful properties
    - CS is **uncorrelated with shape** in the absence of allometry
    - As such, there is a **unique solution** for the quantification of “shape” (when standardizing size effects)
    - CS is an **unambiguous size measure**
    - Of different size measures proposed, CS is the only one that has this property

# Shape Differences

- No difference in shape: landmark coordinates completely coincident
- **Difference** in shape: difference in landmark coordinates
- This provides a measure of shape differences

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/TwoShapes.png")

  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/TwoShapes.png")

- **Procrustes distance**: the square root of the sum of squared deviations of landmark locations between two objects

$$\small{D}_{Proc}=\sqrt{\sum_{i,j}^{k,p}\left(\mathbf{Y}_{1.ij}-\mathbf{Y}_{2.ij}\right)^2}$$

# Shape from Landmarks

- To obtain shape variables, we first need to standardize position, scale and orientation: superimposition
- Several approaches have been proposed (see further on)
- The most robust for most situations, and the main tool of morphometrics is:

# Ordinary Procrustes Analysis: Review

$\small\mathbf{Z}=\frac{1}{CS}\mathbf{(Y-\overline{Y})H}$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/OPA-steps.png")  
```

- With OPA
    - $\small\mathbf{Z}$ are Procrustes residuals (aligned shape)
    - Universal solution for size: CS  (does not depend on choice of a baseline)
    - CS is uncorrelated with shape when no allometry is present
    - Optimal rotation, distributing the displacement among all landmarks
    - **BUT**, OPA is for $\small{n=2}$ objects only

# Generalized Procrustes Analysis

- Perform OPA in iterative fashion

- Steps
    - 1: Using the $\small{1}^{st}$ object as the reference
    - 2: Obtain OPA alignment for all other objects
    - 3: Calculate the consensus (mean) configuration ($\small\mathbf{\overline{Y}}$ )
    - 4: Estimate the total variation in the data ($\small{TSS}$)
    - 5: Repeat steps 2 - 4, using  $\small\mathbf{\overline{Y}}$   as the reference until convergence of $\small{TSS}$ (which will reduce each time)

# GPA: Data Dimensionality

- 2D data initially contain $\small{2p}$ variables: $\small{2}$ coordinates for $\small{p}$ landmarks
- GPA standardized $\small{4}$ dimensions:
    - Translation in X
    - Translation in Y
    - Scaling
    - Rotation

- Therefore, the shape space for GPA-aligned specimens has $\small{2p-4}$ dimensions for 2D data

- For 3D data, dimensionality is $\small{3p-7}$ (general form is: $\small{pk – k – k(k – 1)/2 – 1}$

- Because these dimensions are redundant, standard parametric statistical hypothesis testing will not work (singular covariance matrix... means divide by zero)

- One can eliminate these dimensions via **Orthogonal Projection** or the **thin-plate spline**

######NOTE: as we'll see later, use of permutation methods (RRPP) alleviates this issue.

# GPA: Extensions to Three Dimensions

- GPA works the same with 3D data (matrices simply have $\small{3}^{rd}$ column)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/GorillaSkull.png")  
```

Now we have: $\tiny{Y}=\begin{bmatrix} X_1 & Y_1 & Z_1 \\ 
X_2 & Y_2 & Z_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
X_p & Y_p & Z_p \\
\end{bmatrix}$   & $\small\mathbf{Z}=\frac{1}{CS}\mathbf{(Y-\overline{Y})H}$

- Translation in $\small{x}$, $\small{y}$, and $\small{z}$, directions 
- Scale to $\small{CS=1}$
- Rotate in $\small{(XY)}$, $\small{(XZ)}$, and $\small{(YZ)}$ planes

>- GPA for 3D data standardizes $\small{7}$ dimensions

# Modifications: Full Vs. Partial Procrustes Fitting

- GPA is a regression of $\small\mathbf{Y}_i$ on $\small\mathbf{\overline{Y}}$ after centering and scaling ($\small{CS = 1}$)
    - Fitting can be improved by allowing size to vary
    - Full fitting: superimposition allowing $\small{CS}$ to vary
    - Partial fitting: superimposition after $\small{CS = 1}$

>- NOTE: while mathematically elegant, Full Procrustes is NOT symmetrical 
(i.e. $\small{CS}$ from fitting $\small\mathbf{Y}_1$ on $\small\mathbf{Y}_2$ is not the same as $\small{CS}$ from fitting $\small\mathbf{Y}_2$ on $\small\mathbf{Y}_1$) 

>- In practice, only partial fitting seems useful for empirical studies

# Historical Note: Bookstein's Shape Coordinates

- A straightforward approach to standardize position, orientation and size in landmark coordinates 
    - Position: location of landmark $\small{1}$
    - Orientation: location of landmark $\small{2}$
    - Size: distance between landmarks $\small{1}$ & $\small{2}$

# Bookstein's Shape Coordinates

- A straightforward approach to standardize position, orientation and size in landmark coordinates 
    - Position: location of landmark $\small{1}$
    - Orientation: location of landmark $\small{2}$
    - Size: distance between landmarks $\small{1}$ & $\small{2}$

- Very intuitive, however:
    - Selection of landmarks $\small{1}$ & $\small{2}$, which define the baseline, is arbitrary
    - Choice of baseline alters size and shape estimates
    - Short baselines cause instabilities in shape inference
    - Baseline length IS correlated to shape variables

>- Recommendation: choose long baseline

>- Conclusion: while intuitive and easy to understand, GPA is preferred

# Modifications: Resistant-Fit

- GPA: a globally optimal solution (in the least-squares sense)
    - Spreads shape variation across all landmarks
- If shape variation is localized in a few landmarks this can be a problem     - The 'Pinocchio effect'

- One may desire methods resistant to this effect

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/Pinoccio.png")  
```

# Resistant-Fit Superimposition

- Estimate parameters for translation, scaling and rotation using medians instead of least-squares means

- Example: two shapes that differ only in the front triangle

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/GRF-Example.png")  
```

# Resistant-Fit: Comments

- Advantages:  
    - Method is robust, even when up to 50% of the landmarks are variable
	  - Makes intuitive sense, because shape variation is localized where it occurs

- Disadvantages:  
    - Does not use a specific quantity for optimization, so the quality of  	 	the results cannot be assessed
    - No theoretical framework of shape space available, and statistical properties have not been fully explored
    - In empirical datasets, diagnosing the Pinocchio effect is very difficult (does one even have it?)

>- In practice, for most biological datasets, there is very little difference, so use GPA

# Superimposition: Summary

- Raw landmark coordinates include non-shape information, which we need to account for in order to obtain shape variables
- This is done through superimposition, which removes the effects of location, size and orientation in the data
- **GPA is the preferred method**: intuitive criterion for optimization (LS); statistically robust; well known properties of resulting shape space

- Superimposition (plus projection) creates the shape space where statistical hypotheses are tested
- Because of standardization (location , size, rotation), the resulting shape space has fewer dimensions than the raw data:
    - $\small{2p-4}$ for 2D data
    - $\small{3p-7}$ for 3D data

# Shape Spaces from GPA

- After GPA, each landmark configuration is a point in shape space
- The 'center' of this universe is the consensus (global mean shape)
- Each shape occupies a unique point in shape space
- The metric of shape space is the Procrustes distance $\small{D}_{Proc}$

$$\tiny{D}_{Proc}=\sqrt{\sum_{i,j}^{k,p}\left(\mathbf{Y}_{1.ij}-\mathbf{Y}_{2.ij}\right)^2}$$

- **Shape space is curved!** 

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE,out.width="80%"}
n=2000
p=3
k=2
tri<- arrayspecs(matrix(runif(n*p*k),nrow=n),p=p,k=k)
tri.gpa <- gpagen(tri,Proj = FALSE, print.progress = FALSE)
pc.tri <- prcomp(two.d.array(tri.gpa$coords))$x
mult.pc <- ifelse(which.min(abs(range(pc.tri[,3])))==1,-1,1) #make'up-facing'

plot<-scatterplot3d(pc.tri[,1],pc.tri[,2],mult.pc*pc.tri[,3], asp=1, pch=21,bg="red", tick.marks = FALSE, box=FALSE)

```

######Example with 2,000 random (uniform) triangles. Note overabundance of shapes near 'north pole'.

# Tangent Space

- Statistics in curved spaces become tricky
- Solution: project to a linear space *tangent* to shape space (tangent at the consensus [mean], to minimize distortion)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
  include_graphics("LectureData/03.superimposition/ShapeTang.png")
