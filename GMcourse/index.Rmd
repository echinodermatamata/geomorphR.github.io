  title: "IBE Short Course in Geometric Morphometrics"
  output: html_document
---

The field of geometric morphometrics (GM) is concerned with the quantification and analysis of patterns of shape variation, and its covariation with other variables. The goal of this short course is to provide participants with a working knowledge of the main components of geometric morphometrics, so that as well as practical training in the application of these methods. Because we cannot possibly cover all topics related to morphometrics, the course is organized around some of the most common analyses seen in evolutionary morphometrics studies.

The short course will provide a fundamental understanding of several major concepts in GM methods, including: superimposition, shape variables, shape visualization, and evaluating trends in shape via regression and ANOVA, and examining patterns across the phylogeny. I hope the course serves as a gateway to these methods, and helps everyone move forward in their research!
