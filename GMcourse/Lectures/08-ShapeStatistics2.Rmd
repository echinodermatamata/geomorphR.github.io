### Overview:

+ Revisit RRPP for linear models
+ Common test statistics
+ Simple model evaluation
  + RRPP and exchangeable units under the null hypothesis
+ Multi-model evaluation
  + Nested models
    + Exchangeable units under null hypotheses
    + Types of sums of squares and cross-products
  + Non-nested models
    + Likelihood
    + AIC
+ The ability of RRPP to test better hypotheses
  + Trajectory analysis
  + Disparity analysis
+ The common thread in all statistical analyses.

### Recall, the general linear model provides

+ Estimation of coefficients, $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$
+ Fitted values, based on estimate coefficients, $\hat{\mathbf{Z}} = \mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$.  (Residuals can also be found as $\mathbf{E} =\mathbf{Z} - \hat{\mathbf{Z}}$.)
+ Covariance matrices for residual variation:

$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}} = (n-k)^{-1}\mathbf{\tilde{E}}^T\mathbf{\tilde{E}}$$

+ Covariance matrices for the effect of adding model paramters to a null model.

$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}} = (k-1)^{-1}(\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{alt}-\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{null})^T(\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{alt}-\hat{\mathbf{Z}}_{null})$$
