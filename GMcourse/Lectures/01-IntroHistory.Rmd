#  Motivation

“The study of form may be descriptive merely, or it may become analytical.  We begin by describing the shape of an object in simple words of common speech: we end by defining it in the precise language of mathematics; and the one method tends to follow the other in strict scientific order and historical continuity.”

###### D'Arcy Thompson. (1915). *Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh*

# Morphometrics

- What is morphometrics?
- From Greek: morpho (form) + metrikos (measure)
- The quantification and analysis of morphological objects
- Application of multivariate statistical analysis to the study of variation in plants and animals (Reyment, 1985)

>- The study of size and shape

>- The quantification of form (Lestrel, 2000)

>- The study of shape variation and its covariation with other variables (Bookstein, 1991)

>- This workshop is concerned with the quantification of shape as derived from landmark-based methods, and a proper evaluation of patterns of shape variation relative to explanatory variables

# Why Study Shape?

- Historical reasons: natural history studies are largely morphological
- Shape differences delineate obvious biological groups (i.e. alpha-taxonomy)
- Shape covaries with other variables
- Understanding shape and biological form may lead to understanding function

# Why Study Shape?

- Historical reasons: natural history studies are largely morphological
- Shape differences delineate obvious biological groups (i.e. alpha-taxonomy)
- Shape covaries with other variables
- Understanding shape and biological form may lead to understanding function

**To properly study shape we require a definition of it**

>- The geometric properties of an object that are invariant to changes in translation, rotation, and scale (Bookstein 1991); Dryden and Mardia (1998)

>- or... The variation that remains once position, orientation, and scale have been mathematically held constant

# Form and Shape

- For much of the history of biological inquiry, form and shape were synonymous 

- Plato & Aristotle: believed that understanding form lead to understanding of function

- Geothe: ‘morphology’ the form of an organism

- Form and shape historically used interchangeably

>- Now, more formal definitions of form and shape exist, which provide important distinctions

>- Specifically, `Form = size + shape` (current definition)

# Early Uses of Morphology

- For centuries, biologists used morphology to compare organisms

- Species taxonomy, classification, and ecological specialization were all addressed using anatomical properties

- However, morphology was typically described qualitatively, leading to limitations

- Much of the richness of morphological variation not captured

- Limits comparisons to 2 objects (same or different)
For > 2 objects, only rank-orderings could be done (A >B >C)

- Rank-ordering implies differences on a continuous scale

- Thus, there was a need to quantitatively compare morphology

>- **This moves towards a notion of shape and shape differences**

###### Early versions were qualitative. This week we learn the thin-plate spline which enables accurate shape transformations

# The Biometric Tradition

- Use of quantitative data began in the late 1800s: variables were measured (e.g., wing length) and group means compared

- Morphometric advances concurrent with statistical advances

- **LATE 1800s – EARLY 1900s**

- Galton: variation, correlation, regression

- Pearson: more on correlation, $\small\chi^2$ 

- From this the Biometric tradition was formed, believing that most of biological variation was continuous

- Early 1900s: BIG biological debate: Biometric vs. Mendelian (continuous vs. discontinuous biological variation)

# Development of Statistics

- Statistics developed (as a field) with evolutionary biology

- ANOVA / Variance partitioning (Fisher: for quantitative genetics and more generally)

- Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA/CVA), MANOVA, 

- Generalized distance (Fisher, Mahalanobis, Rao)

- Principal Components Analysis (Pearson, Hotelling)

- Multivariate t-test (Hotelling)

- Factor Analysis (Spearman)

- Path Analysis (Wright)

>- Most data used were biological

>- *THIS* paved the way for morphometrics

# Multivariate Morphometrics

- Multivariate analysis of morphological measurements 

- Within- and between-group variation described and compared 

- Commonly used methods: principal components, canonical variates, discriminant function (see Blackith and Reyment, 1971)

# Geometric Morphometrics

- 1980s-1990s: Theoretical advances and data types caused radical shift in morphometric methods

- **Geometric Morphometric Methods (GMM) emerged**

- Rigorous quantification of shape coupled with sound statistics and graphical visualization

- Emphasis on landmarks due to more formal statistical theory

- Procrustes Paradigm: rigorous quantification of shape from points, curves, and surfaces

- Analysis of shape variation with graphical description of results

# Measuring Shapes

- **Morphometrics: the study of shape variation and its covariation**

- How to quantify shape?  There are no *natural* units for shape
    - Use a set of proxy variables to represent shape (morphometric traits)
    - Different approaches use different types of variables and methodologies to obtain them

- **Morphometrics: the study of shape variation and its covariation**

- How to quantify shape?  There are no *natural* units for shape
    - Use a set of proxy variables to represent shape (morphometric traits)
    - Different approaches use different types of variables and methodologies to obtain them

- **Data should**

- Register shape in a repeatable manner and archive it for statistical analyses

- Contain enough information to reconstruct a graphical representation of the structure of interest

- Be appropriate to address the biological question of interest

# Morphometric Data

- Morphometric data may quantify:

- The location of discrete anatomic features (**points**)

- Distances between anatomic features (**lines**)

- Outlines of a structure (**curves**)

- The surface of a structure (**surfaces**)

>- The modern morphometric synthesis permits the combination of ALL these types of data

# Homology in Morphometrics

- Data must quantify shape in a repeatable manner

- Homology: correspondence across specimens

- Evolutionary homology: structures derived from the same tissue of the most recent common ancestor

- Operational homology: correspondence in the position of structures

- In Morphometrics, we may use both, depending on the question to answer

- The important point is to obtain **repeatable** data

# Data Types: Linear Measurements

- Use linear measurements, angles, etc., between anatomic features, or structures (e.g. head width)

- Use some method to eliminate non-shape variation (size)

- Analyze the data using multivariate statistics

- aka 'traditional' or “multivariate” morphometrics

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/LizardMultiMorph.png")  
```

# Linear Measurements: Considerations

**Advantages**

- Allow comparison to previous studies

- The variables used are very intuitive and easy to interpret biologically

**Disadvantages**

- Size is a latent factor and there is no global consensus on how to account for it – different approaches provide different results

- The same values may represent different shapes

- Homology is difficult to evaluate and guarantee

- Usually it is difficult to obtain a graphical representation of variation in shape (because the geometry of the structure is not preserved in the analysis)

Something is missing! The relative positions of the distances on the structure

# The Truss

- An interconnected network of distance measurements between anatomical points

- An effort to maintain the relative positions between traits

- Can provide a graphical representation

- BUT statistical treatment is problematic

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/Truss.png")  
```

# The Morphometric Revolution

- In the 1980s, there is a radical shift in methodology

- Linear measurements do not capture all of the properties required to describe shape

- The truss was an attempt to record relative positions

- This information is inherent in the common endpoints of linear distances

- Change from linear measurements to the locations of points themselves

- Use **landmark coordinates** as the raw data

This advance was aided by the simultaneous development of mathematical shape theory

# Data Types: Landmark Coordinates

- Use x, y (or x, y, z) coordinates of anatomic locations to quantify anatomical variation

- Eliminate non-shape variation (size and others, see further on)

- Multivariate data analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/LandLIzard.png")  
```

- 'Landmarks are the points at which one’s explanations of biological processes are grounded.'  Bookstein (1990)

# Types of Landmarks

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/LandmarkTypes.png")  
```

# Landmarks: Considerations

**Advantages**

- Easy to assess homology, so biological interpretation is more robust

- The geometry of the studied structure is maintained in relative landmark locations

- Can obtain a visual representation of shape variation

**Disadvantages**

- Raw data include information that is NOT about form (e.g. location, scale, orientation)
- Some structures have few or no landmarks

###### These issues are alleviated through Geometric Morphometric methods and its extensions to other data types, see further on

# Data Types: Curves

- Some structures have few, or no, landmarks

- One may be interested in outlines, or other curves, to quantify shape

- Types of curves
    - **Partial**: different starting and ending points
    - **Complete**: the starting and ending point coincide (closed curves)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/Curves.png")  
```

# Curves: Considerations

**Advantages**

- Useful when there are few, or no, landmarks

- They register a full representation of the outline (and therefore we can obtain a graphical representation of shape variation)

**Disadvantages**

- Difficult to assess homology

- Several analytical approaches exist, which provide different variables, and comparison among them is not straightforward (there is no globally accepted way to measure the shape of a curve)

- Most methods do not allow the combination of curves and landmarks

- Some curves may represent different shapes

###### But see next! – The Procrustes paradigm allows the combination of points, curves and surfaces

# Semilandmarks

- They resolve the problems encountered when working with curves

- Can be quantified on curves (2D) or surfaces (3D)

- They are treated as “degenerate” landmarks, the position of which is limited to slide on a curve (or surface) during analysis

- Only variation perpendicular to the curve is relevant

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/Semilandmarks.png")  
```

# Semilandmarks: Considerations

**Advantages**

- Good representation of curves, outlines and surfaces

- They allow the examination of curves and surfaces in Procrustes shape space (which has known statistical properties)

- It is possible to combine different morphological features (points, curves, surfaces) in a single analysis of form

# The Procrustes Paradigm

- Combining landmarks and semilandmarks there is a general solution for quantifying biological shape variation

- We obtain quantitative information that represents:
    - Discrete anatomical points
    - Curves (outlines) of structures
    - Surfaces of structures

- We can combine it all in a single analysis!

# Special Considerations: Missing Data

- Sometimes landmarks are missing

- Methods to estimate their location exist (discussed later this week)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/Missing.png")  
```

# Special Considerations: Symmetry

- Sometimes objects display symmetry

- GMM procedures adjusted slightly for this  (discussed later this week)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("LectureData/01.Intro/Symmetry.png")  
```

# Dean's View of Quantitative Biology

- Methods are a product of theory and data type

- Choose methods that are mathematically sound, but also theoretically and biologically sound

- METHODS SHOULD NOT INTRODUCE PATTERNS!!!!
