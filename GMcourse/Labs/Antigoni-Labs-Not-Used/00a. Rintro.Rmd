## **Content description**
A basic knowledge of R is a requirement for following this course, and it will be considered a standard during the labs. However, here we provide you a short guide to some basic operations, as a resource for solving some basic practical problems you might encounter. We encourage you to sharpen your R skills as much as possible in the future. It is a great tool, and an ever-learning path to follow!

R is a statistical programming environment with many built-in mathematical functions and many others that are found in packages that can be installed. Geomorph is one such package.  

Analyses in R are performed using a series of commands which are written in script files and passed to the main console. The general workflow is:
1. OPEN R or Rstudio
2. OPEN R-script
3. Define your working directory 
4. Run analyses

## **Some R basics**
```{r eval=TRUE}
3 -> a  # Assign value to variable
a

b <- c(3,4,5)   # 'c' combines values into vector or list
b
b[2]	# Access items in vectors by calling their position (aka indexing)

a <- rnorm(50) # Generate random normal vector
b <- rnorm(a)
plot(a, b)      # A simple plot

c <- cbind(a, b)    # Binds columns together (rbind does same by rows)
c
c[1]   # first element
c[1,]	 # first row
c[,1]  # first column

rbind(a,b)

ls() # See which R objects are now in the R workspace
```

## **Some base functions**
```{r eval=TRUE}
sum(a)
mean(a)
min(a)
max(a)
var(a)
a^2		# Square values
sqrt(a)	# NaN for negative values
abs(a)
cor(a,b)

?cor   # Call help page for information

rm(list=ls())   # Remove items in memory
```

## **Matrix operations**
```{r eval=FALSE}
a <- matrix(c(1,0,4,2,-1,1), nrow=3)
b <- matrix(c(1,-1,2,1,1,0), nrow=2)
a
b

c <- t(a)	# Matrix transpose
a
c

2*a	# Scalar multiplication

# Matrix addition and subtraction
b+c
b-c
a+b		# NOTE: non-conformable matrices (check rxc of your matrices!)

# Elementwise multiplication
c
b
c*b

# Matrix multiplication
a%*%b		## %*% is symbol for matrix multiplication
b%*%a		## matrix order matters
```	

## **Reading data**
```{r eval=FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv(file="Data/01-RIntroData.csv", header=T)
mydata
str(mydata)

# Maybe cannot remember directory?
mydata <- read.csv(file.choose())

Y <- as.matrix(mydata[,(2:3)])
FactorA <- as.factor(mydata[,4])
Y
FactorA
```

## **The 'apply' functions**
Includes apply, sapply, tapply, lapply. A **VERY** useful family, that loop over data and do things, e.g.:
```{r eval=FALSE}
apply(Y, 2, sd)    # Here, we obtain the std for each column of a matrix

tapply(Y[,1], FactorA, mean)	# Obtain means for first column for levels of FactorA
tapply(Y[,2], FactorA, mean)	# Obtain means for first column for levels of FactorA
tapply(Y, FactorA, mean)		  # Try entire matrix: doesn't work

rowsum(Y, FactorA)/as.vector(table(FactorA))    #This obtains means. Could also use a for loop.
```

## **Some basic statistics**
```{r eval=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(mydata$y ~ mydata$x)  # Run regression
summary(model1)
anova(model1)  # Generates anova table of results

# A plot with regression line
plot(mydata$x, mydata$y)
abline(coef(model1))
```

## **Getting help**
This is by far **the most important** R-skill! 
For known functions, you can get help either in the help panel of Rstudio, or using ?
```{r eval=TRUE}
?mean
```

If you donÂ´t know the name of the function, but have some idea of what it does, you can do fuzzy-matching search:
```{r eval=TRUE}
??components
```
The results you get, will depend on the packages you have installed.
